What is it?
===========

Django Appschema is born from the idea proposed by *tidbids* on
`SaaS with Django and PostgreSQL <http://tidbids.posterous.com/saas-with-django-and-postgresql>`_ and `SaaS with Django and PostgreSQL Schemas <http://tidbids.posterous.com/saas-with-django-and-postgresql-schemas>`_.

The main idea is to isolate customer's data in different schema. One customer = one schema. There are very good explanations on why schemas and what it could bring to your SaaS application on `this thread on Hacker News <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1565674>`_.

How it work?
============

On the running side, schema isolation is quite easy, set up a middleware that make dispatch, a signal and *voil√†* (almost).

Django Appschema creates a table containing a ``public_name`` (could be FQDN or whatever your middleware decides) and a associated schema. This table should be shared by all schemas you'll create.

Now the complicated part. Performing syncdb on multiple schemas could be a bit difficult, specially if you want to share some apps and isolate some others (or both).

On your configuration file, you'll add ``APPSCHEMA_SHARED_APPS`` which is a list containing the apps you want to share. Basically, shared apps tables are created in ``public`` schema.

Appschema will alway be a shared app. If installed, South will be both shared and isolated.

Appschema comes with modified versions of ``syncdb`` and ``migrate`` that will perform required operations on schemas.

Another management command called ``createschema`` allows you to create a new schema and performs syncdb (and migrate if available) on the new created schema.

Please note
============

This **highly experimental** app works **only for PostgreSQL**.

If you look at the code, you'll find a function called ``new_schema``. You could be tempted to use it directly in your web app (for registration purpose). DON'T. NEVER. SERIOUSLY. In order to run properly, commands modify INSTALLED_APPS and the Django apps cache during execution. What is not an issue during a management command could become a nightmare in a runing Django process.

I'm looking at a cool solution for this issue (master schema duplication or raw sql generation in a module).

You'll find a FqdnMiddleware which switchs schema based on the host name of the HTTP request. Feel free to make your own based on your needs.

If you find bugs (and I'm sure you will), please report them.
